these are my journey notes from javascript backend roadmap by hitesh (chai with code)

(1)how to deploy backend code in production

    computer/mobile <- [connected through express] -> server

    listen - listening 
    / home router
    requests - get
    
    express- a web framework

    A server in the backend is a system (hardware or software) that processes requests from clients (such as browsers or mobile apps) and returns responses.

    servers are all about responses and requests.
