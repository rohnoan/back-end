these are my journey notes from javascript backend roadmap by hitesh (chai with code)
(1)road map

(2)how to deploy backend code in production

    computer/mobile <- [connected through express] -> server

    listen - listening 
    / home router
    requests - get
    
    express- a web framework

    A server in the backend is a system (hardware or software) that processes requests from clients (such as browsers or mobile apps) and returns responses.

    servers are all about responses and requests.

(3)frontend + backend  
    proxy and cors
    use proxy to not fuck w cors(cross origin errors)

    bad practice- keep frontend and backend differently

(4)taking backend to next level

(5)data modelling for backend with mongoose
    moon modeler/erasor for modelling data
    how to - make a blank screen and then see what all data to store when ur going through the app
